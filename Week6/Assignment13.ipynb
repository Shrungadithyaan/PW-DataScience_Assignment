    "1. Social Media Integration:\n",
    "   - Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram provide APIs that allow developers to integrate their applications with these platforms.\n",
    "   - For example, a website or mobile app may use the Facebook API to allow users to log in using their Facebook credentials or share content directly to their Facebook profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Payment Gateways:\n",
    "   - Payment gateways, such as PayPal, Stripe, and Braintree, provide APIs that enable businesses to accept online payments.\n",
    "   - E-commerce websites can integrate these APIs to process payments securely and provide a seamless checkout experience for their customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Maps and Geolocation Services:\n",
    "   - Services like Google Maps and Mapbox provide APIs for developers to embed maps, geolocation, and routing features in their applications.\n",
    "   - Applications can use these APIs to display maps, search for locations, get directions, and perform geolocation-based operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Weather Data:\n",
    "   - Weather service providers, such as OpenWeatherMap and WeatherAPI, offer APIs to access weather data programmatically.\n",
    "   - Applications can use these APIs to retrieve current weather conditions, forecasts, and historical weather data for various locations.\n",
