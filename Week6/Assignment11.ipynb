    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a set of SQL commands used to define and manipulate the structure of a database, such as creating, modifying, or deleting database objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of the commonly used DDL commands with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE: The CREATE command is used to create a new database object, such as a table, view, index, or schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Creating a table named \"employees\" with columns for employee ID, name, and salary:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "       id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "       salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DROP: The DROP command is used to remove an existing database object, such as a table, view, or index.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Dropping the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER: The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as adding or renaming columns, modifying constraints, or altering table properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Adding a new column \"department\" to the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE command is used to delete all rows from a table while keeping the table structure intact. It is a faster alternative to the DELETE command for removing all data from a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Truncating the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of the commonly used DML commands with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. INSERT: The INSERT command is used to add new rows of data into a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Inserting a new record into the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 50000);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. UPDATE: The UPDATE command is used to modify existing data in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Updating the salary of an employee with ID 1 in the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   UPDATE employees SET salary = 55000 WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DELETE: The DELETE command is used to remove one or more rows of data from a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Deleting an employee record with ID 1 from the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "   \n",

    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of the SELECT command with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT: The SELECT command is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It allows you to specify the columns you want to retrieve, apply filters, sort the results, and perform various other operations.\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This query will retrieve the \"name\" and \"salary\" columns from the \"employees\" table and return the result set containing the names and salaries of all employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT queries can also include various clauses and keywords to refine the data retrieval:\n",
    "\n",
    "- WHERE clause: It is used to apply conditions to filter the data based on specific criteria. For example, retrieving employees with a salary greater than 50000:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- ORDER BY clause: It is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order. For example, retrieving employees sorted by salary in descending order:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT name, salary FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- LIMIT clause: It is used to limit the number of rows returned in the result set. For example, retrieving the top 5 highest-paid employees:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT name, salary FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 5;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "The SELECT command is a powerful tool for querying and retrieving specific data from a database. It allows you to define the columns you need, filter the results, sort the data, and control the number of rows returned. It forms the foundation of data retrieval in SQL and enables you to extract meaningful information from your database tables."

    "\n",
    "2. `execute()`: The `execute()` method of the cursor object is used to execute a SQL query. It takes the SQL statement as a parameter. In the example code, we execute the `SELECT * FROM employees` query, which retrieves all rows from the \"employees\" table. The `execute()` method can also take additional parameters for passing values in parameterized queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the query is executed, we can fetch the data using methods like `fetchone()`, `fetchmany()`, or `fetchall()`, depending on the number of rows we expect to retrieve. In the example, we use `fetchall()` to retrieve all rows returned by the query.\n",
    "\n",
