    "Outliers can have a significant impact on measures of central tendency and dispersion in a dataset. An outlier is an extreme value that is unusually distant from the rest of the data points. When present in a dataset, outliers can distort the typical characteristics of the data, affecting both the central tendency and the spread of the data."
